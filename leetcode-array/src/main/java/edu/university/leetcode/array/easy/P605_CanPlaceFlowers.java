/**
 * 605. Can Place Flowers
 * You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.
 * Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer n,
 * return if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.
 * Example 1: Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1 Output: true
 * Example 2: Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2 Output: false
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 104
 * flowerbed[i] is 0 or 1.
 * There are no two adjacent flowers in flowerbed.
 * 0 <= n <= flowerbed.length
